# Welcome to WASA 2023

With the advent of software and electronics, automotive companies are enabling innovation to improve safety, security, driver experience, and driving automation. Moreover, the complexity and size of software keep growing because of future innovations, such as self-learning algorithms and automated driving, which all lead to the ultimate goal of autonomously driving vehicles. Consequently, the increasing use of software introduced the paradigm shift by requiring automotive companies to develop their systems using architecture and model-based techniques. Although model-based techniques, e.g. MATLAB/Simulink and Stateflow, are being accepted in the automotive industry as standard languages and tools for developing automotive control software, system and software architecture techniques are still far from being widely accepted. This excludes the AUTOSAR standard, which defines the language for designing and configuring automotive software architectures and identifies major architectural components of automotive systems. 

This workshop aims to address issues related to the appropriate automotive system/software architecture and engineering techniques, which the automotive industry can accept. Therefore, to bring together researchers and practitioners in automotive system/software architecture and engineering, WASA is being organized with the [International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA)](https://icsa-conferences.org/2023/), the premier international software architecture conference. Our goal is that the workshop will identify new research directions, roadmaps, challenges and establish long-term collaborations between participants from both academia and industry even after the workshop.

| 9:10 - 9:50          | Keynote: _On the confluence of conceptual modeling and behavior via a posteriori typing_ by Prof. Alfonso Pierantonio_ Abstract:As realized in most traditional object-oriented notations, the concept of classification has certain limitations that may inhibit its application to modeling more complex phenomena. This is likely to prove problematic as modern software becomes increasingly more integrated with the highly dynamic physical world, and extending classification to dynamic entities may be considered helpful. Over the last decade, several approaches to posteriori typing have been introduced; however, they failed to provide a more conceptual way of describing behavior. In this presentation, we first provide a detailed description of the current limitations in existing object-oriented notations, followed by an outline of a novel approach to classification designed to overcome them. The proposed approach replaces the static multiple-inheritance hierarchy approach found in many object-oriented languages with multiple dynamic class hierarchies, each based on different classification criteria. Furthermore, it supports potentially overlapping class membership within any given scheme to better deal with ambiguous classification schemes. |
